# FINTECH
A mini fintech  API that allows users register, authenticate, payout and fund their NGN wallet.

# Built With

The system was built using Nodejs, while consuming external Apis, e.g Flutterwaves Api, Paystacks Api, Nodemailer api

# Getting Started

## Prerequisites

Your system must have npm and node installed, and this can be done on the terminal with 

```
- npm install npm@latest -g
```

## Installation

```
- Clone the repo https://github.com/AdemolaAdedoyin/fintech.git
- Install npm packages, `npm install`
- This is a locally hosted api, so you have to have `mySQL database server` running on your system. Either through xampp or installed using brew.
- A database to use must exist, and the name of this database will be passed when trying to start the server.
- You need to have an account on [Moneywave] (https://moneywave.azurewebsites.net/#/login), to get test api and secret keys that will be used on the system.
- You need to have an account on [paystack] (https://dashboard.paystack.com/#/login), to get test public key that will be used on the system.
